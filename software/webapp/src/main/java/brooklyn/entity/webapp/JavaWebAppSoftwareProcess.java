     * Deploys the given artifact, from a source URL, to a given deployment filename/context.
     * There is some variance in expected filename/context at various servers,
     * so the following conventions are followed:
     * <p>
     *   either ROOT.WAR or /       denotes root context
     * <p>
     *   anything of form  FOO.?AR  (ending .?AR) is copied with that name (unless copying not necessary)
     *                              and is expected to be served from /FOO
     * <p>
     *   anything of form  /FOO     (with leading slash) is expected to be served from /FOO
     *                              (and is copied as FOO.WAR)
     * <p>
     *   anything of form  FOO      (without a dot) is expected to be served from /FOO
     *                              (and is copied as FOO.WAR)
     * <p>
     *   otherwise <i>please note</i> behaviour may vary on different appservers;
     *   e.g. FOO.FOO would probably be ignored on appservers which expect a file copied across (usually),
     *   but served as /FOO.FOO on systems that take a deployment context.
     * <p>
     * See {@link FileNameToContextMappingTest} for definitive examples!
     *
     * @param url  where to get the war, as a URL, either classpath://xxx or file:///home/xxx or http(s)...
     * @param targetName  where to tell the server to serve the WAR, see above
