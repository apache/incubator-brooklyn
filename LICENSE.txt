    Product in any manner except as expressly permitted in this Agreement;
    (b) transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, or sublicense the Product

    property of Cloudsoft and its licensors, and, except as expressly
    provided herein, Cloudsoft and its licensors retain all right, title

    Product including without limitation any functionality issues, and
    errors, flaws, failures, or faults in the Product (collectively,
    'Feedback') via an online Cloudsoft forum or other method.  Licensee
    hereby grants to Cloudsoft a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide,
    sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free, fully-paid, right and
    license to use and exploit in any manner and for any purpose all
    Feedback and related information.

5.  Confidential Information.  The Product and Materials contain
    Confidential Information and trade secrets of Cloudsoft and its licensors.
    'Confidential Information' means all software code and information
    furnished by Cloudsoft in oral, written or machine-readable form,
    disclosed as a result of this Agreement, and that should reasonably
    have been understood by Licensee, because of legends or other markings,
    the circumstances of disclosure or the nature of the information
    itself, to be proprietary and confidential to Cloudsoft, a Cloudsoft
    affiliate or other third party.  Licensee will use the same standard of
    care to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of the
    Confidential Information that Licensee uses to prevent the disclosure
    of its own similar confidential information, but in no event less than
    a reasonable standard of care.  Licensee will disclose the Confidential
    Information only to its employees with a need to know for the purposes
    of this Agreement.  The restrictions of this Agreement on use and
    disclosure of Confidential Information shall not apply to information
    that becomes publicly known through no fault of the Licensee or its
    personnel.  All obligations regarding Confidential Information received
    prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement shall survive
    the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

    TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE; OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN
    CONNECTION WITH ANY MALFUNCTIONS, DELAYS, LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS,
    LOST SAVINGS, INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATORY
    PROFITS, EVEN IF CLOUDSOFT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

    ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
    NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR OTHERWISE WILL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES AND
    WILL NOT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (US $1,000).  THE ALLOCATIONS OF
    LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION 7 REPRESENT THE AGREED AND BARGAINED FOR
    UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES, AND THE COMPENSATION OF CLOUDSOFT FOR THE

    LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS ARE AN ALLOCATION OF THE RISK
    BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

8.  Term and Termination.  The term of this Agreement will begin on the
    earlier of the date this Agreement is accepted by Licensee or

    Agreement will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

9.  Government Rights.  The Products under this Agreement are 'commercial
    computer Products' as that term is described in DFAR
    252.227-7014(a)(1).  If acquired by or on behalf of a civilian agency,
    the U.S.  Government acquires this commercial computer Products and/or
    commercial computer Products documentation subject to the terms and
    this Agreement as specified in 48C.F.R.  12.212 (Computer Products) and
    12.11 (Technical Data) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations ('FAR')
    and its successors.  If acquired by or on behalf of any agency within

10.  General.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
    parties concerning the subject matter hereof, notwithstanding any
    different or additional terms that may be contained in the form of
    purchase order or other document used by Licensee to place orders or
    otherwise effect transactions hereunder, which such terms are hereby
    rejected.  This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
    discussions, proposals and agreements between the parties relating to
    the subject matter hereof, provided that if Licensee has entered into
    or later enters into another valid agreement with Cloudsoft regarding
    the Product (whether or not such other valid agreement was physically
    executed by Licensee, including without limitation any 'click-through'
    agreement or any applicable terms and conditions posted on any
    Cloudsoft website), then such other agreement shall supersede this
    Agreement.  No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
    this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both
    parties.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
    unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and
    effect and such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
    possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and will be reformed
    to the extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    No waiver of rights by either party may be implied from any actions or
    failures to enforce rights under this Agreement.  Neither party will be
    liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform due to causes
    beyond its reasonable control (excluding payment of monies due).
    Unless otherwise specifically stated, the terms of this Agreement are
    intended to be and are solely for the benefit of Cloudsoft and Licensee
    and do not create any right in favor of any third party.  This
    Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
    of the United States and the State of California without reference to
    its conflict of laws principles.  All disputes arising out of or
    relating to this Agreement will be submitted to the non-exclusive
    jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction located in the
    Northern District of California or a state court located in San
    Francisco, California, and each party irrevocably consents to such
    personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this venue.  All
    notices must be in writing and will be effective three (3) days after
    the date sent.
