Without being too restrictive about how you have to code as part of Brooklyn,
there are some style points that really make life easier when sharing code
among ourselves:

* Use spaces (not tabs!) with 4 spaces indentation
* Keep line length <=128
* Don't reformat code or organize imports unless there's very good
  reason (this makes history and merges much harder)
