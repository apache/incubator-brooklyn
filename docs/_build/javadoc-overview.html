Javadoc for <a href="http://brooklyn.io"> Apache Brooklyn</a> 0.8.0-SNAPSHOT

<p>
                Apache Brooklyn is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the 
                Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
                infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
                successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of
                the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
