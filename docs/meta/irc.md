# IRC
IRC is a basic group chat system used by many open source projects to enable developers to collaborate and to help users communicate and support each other. Brooklyn has an IRC channel where where users and developers hang out.

## Getting Help On IRC

When you connect to the Brooklyn IRC channel, say Hi and then ask your question. (Be patient if you dont' get an instant answer - unless there's already a conversation happening folk will probably not have their eyes on the channel.) It may take a little while for someone to see and respond to your question.

You may want to do other things while you wait, like reviewing the brooklyn-users and brooklyn-dev lists to see if anyone has had the same issue before.
