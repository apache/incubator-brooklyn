Brooklyn provides a **catalog**, which is a persisted collection of versioned blueprints. 
These can be deployed directly or referenced by other blueprints. 
Blueprints in the catalog can be deployed via the Brooklyn REST API, or from 
the web-console's "Catalog" tab of the "Create Application" wizard dialog box.

### Catalog Items

An item to be added to the catalog is defined in YAML. This follows the syntax of a 
YAML blueprint with an addition `brooklyn.catalog` section giving 
the metadata needed to register the blueprint in the catalog:

{% highlight yaml %}
brooklyn.catalog:
  id: my-MySQL
  version: 1.0
  iconUrl: classpath://mysql.png
  description: MySql is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS)
  libraries:
    - url: http://example.com/path/to/my-dependency-1.2.3.jar
    - url: http://example.com/path/to/my-other-dependency-4.5.6.jar

services:
- type: brooklyn.entity.database.mysql.MySqlNode
{% endhighlight %}

To explain the `brooklyn.catalog` fields:

- The `id: MySQL` line specifies a unique ID used by Brooklyn to identify the catalog item. 
  Other blueprints can reference the catalog item using this ID.
- The `version: 1.0` line provides a unique version for the *blueprint*. 
  Note that this is typically *not* the version of the software being installed (in this case MySQL).
- The `iconUrl: classpath://...` is an optional line where an icon can be specified 
  for use with the item (in the "Add Application" dialog and elsewhere).
  Note that `classpath` URLs *cannot* refer to items in the OSGi bundle 
  (to prevent requiring all OSGi bundles to be loaded at launch);
  use the server supplying the OSGi bundles or the `conf` folder of the Brooklyn distro instead.
- The `description: ...` line, also optional, allows supplying a free-format description of the blueprint.


The `libraries` section references OSGi bundles required for the blueprint. It can be omitted if everything
required by the blueprint is already on the Brooklyn classpath.
These URL's should be to stable OSGi bundles;
if the contents at any of these URLs changes, the behaviour of the blueprint may change 
whenever a bundle is reloaded in a Brooklyn server,
and if entities have been deployed against that version, their behavior may change in subtle or potentially incompatible ways.
To avoid this situation, it is highly recommended to use OSGi version stamps as part of the URL.

To reference a catalog item in another blueprint, simply reference its ID and optionally its version number.
For example: 

{% highlight yaml %}
services:
- type: my-MySQL:1.0
{% endhighlight %}


### Adding to the Catalog

To add a catalog item to the catalog, `POST` the YAML file to `/v1/catalog` endpoint in
Brooklyn's REST API.
To do this using `curl`:

{% highlight bash %}
curl http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/catalog --data-binary @/path/to/mysql-catalog.yaml
{% endhighlight %}



### Deleting from the Catalog

You can delete a versioned item from the catalog using the same endpoint at the REST API. 
For example, to delete the item with ID `my-MySQL` and version `1.0` with `curl`:

{% highlight bash %}
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/catalog/entities/MySQL/1.0
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** Catalog items should not be deleted if there are running apps which were created using the same item. 
During rebinding the catalog item is used to reconstruct the entity.


### Versioning

Version numbers follow the OSGi convention. This can have a major, minor, micro and qualifier part.
For example, `1.0`. `1.0.1` or `1.0.1-20150101`.

The combination of `id:version` strings must be unique across the catalog.
It is an error to deploy the same version of an existing item:
to update a blueprint, it is recommended to increase its version number;
alternatively in some cases it is permitted to delete an `id:version` instance
and then re-deploy.
If no version is specified, re-deploying will automatically
increment an internal version number for the catalog item.

When referencing a blueprint, if a version number is not specified 
the latest non-snapshot version will be loaded when an entity is instantiated.


<a id="special-reqs"/>

### Special Requirements for the "Create Application" Wizard Dialog

For a blueprint in the catalog to be accessible via the 'Create Application' dialog, it must be an Application 
(i.e. the entity at the root of the blueprint must implement `brooklyn.entity.Application`).
In contrast, if a YAML blueprint is deployed direct via the REST API, then this is not necessary.

For example, the MySql catalog item defined previously could be re-written to use a
`brooklyn.entity.basic.BasicApplication`, because no application-specific logic is 
required other than to pass-through the start and stop commands.
the `MySqlNode` is added as a child of the `BasicApplication`.

{% highlight yaml %}
brooklyn.catalog:
  id: my-MySQL
  version: 1.0
  iconUrl: classpath://mysql.png
  description: MySql is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS)

name: MySQL Database
services:
- type: brooklyn.entity.basic.BasicApplication
  brooklyn.children:
  - type: brooklyn.entity.database.mysql.MySqlNode
{% endhighlight %}

When added to the catalog via the HTTP `POST` command, the blueprint will appear in the 'Create Application' dialog
as shown here:

[![MySQL in Brooklyn Catalog](mysql-in-catalog-w700.png "MySQL in Brooklyn Catalog")](mysql-in-catalog.png) 

When deploying a new version of a blueprint, the catalog will show both the previous and the new versions 
of the blueprint. You may wish to delete the older version, assuming no applications currently running
are using that old version.

<!--
TODO: Should improve the 'Create Application' dialog, so that the two versions don't appear on the front page.
Currently they are indistinguisable, if they have the same description/icon.

<!--
TODO: Add section that explains how to add plain entities to the catalog and use them either from the App Wizard,
(and entity UI) or embed the catalog id + version in another YAML
-->

<!--
TODO: Add documentation to explain that the brooklyn.catalog section can contain a libraries array, each item pointing to 
an OSGi bundle where the code for the blueprint is hosted. Every type from the blueprint will be searched for in the 
libraries first and then on the standard Brooklyn classpath.*
