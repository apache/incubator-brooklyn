This guide will walk you through deploying an example 3-tier web application to a public cloud. 

This tutorial assumes that you are using Linux or Mac OSX.

## Install Brooklyn

Download Brooklyn and obtain a binary build as described on [the download page]({{site.path.website}}/download/).

{% if brooklyn_version contains 'SNAPSHOT' %}
Expand the `tar.gz` archive (note: as this is a -SNAPSHOT version, your filename will be slightly different):
{% else %}
Expand the `tar.gz` archive:
{% endif %}

{% if brooklyn_version contains 'SNAPSHOT' %}
{% highlight bash %}
$ tar -zxf brooklyn-dist-{{ site.brooklyn-version }}-timestamp-dist.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}
{% else %}
{% highlight bash %}
$ tar -zxf brooklyn-{{ site.brooklyn-version }}-dist.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}
{% endif %}

This will create a `brooklyn-{{ site.brooklyn-version }}` folder.

**Note**: You'll need a Java JRE or SDK installed (version 6 or later), as Brooklyn is Java under the covers.

**Node #2**: If you want to test Brooklyn on localhost, follow [these instructions]({{site.path.guide}}/ops/locations/#localhost) 
to ensure that your Brooklyn can access your machine.


## Launch Brooklyn

Now start Brooklyn with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd brooklyn-{{ site.brooklyn.version }}
$ bin/brooklyn launch
{% endhighlight %}

Brooklyn will output the address of the management interface:

<pre>
INFO  Starting brooklyn web-console on loopback interface because no security config is set
INFO  Started Brooklyn console at http://127.0.0.1:8081/, running classpath://brooklyn.war and []
</pre>


### Next

Next, open the web console on [127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081). 
No applications have been deployed yet, so the "Create Application" dialog opens automatically:
let's remedy this by **[deploying a blueprint](blueprints.html)**. 

It is not necessary at this time, but depending on what you are going to do, 
you may wish to set up other configuration options first:
 
* [Security](../ops/brooklyn_properties.html)
* [Persistence](../ops/persistence/)
* [Cloud credentials](../ops/locations/)
