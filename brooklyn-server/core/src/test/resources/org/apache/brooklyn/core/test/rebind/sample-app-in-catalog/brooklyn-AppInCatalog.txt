The file brooklyn-AppInCatalog.txt is used in RebindCatalogEntityTest, 
to test catalog.addItem where that item is in a jar not originally
on the classpath.

The jar contains its source code. 

Assuming the `dist` is built, you can expand and rebuild it 
(optionally making edits halfway through) with:

    mkdir tmp ; cd tmp ; jar xvf ../brooklyn-AppInCatalog.jar
    javac -cp "../../../../../../../../../../../../usage/dist/target/brooklyn-dist/brooklyn/lib/brooklyn/*" org/apache/brooklyn/core/test/rebind/sample_app_in_catalog/AppInCatalog.java 
    jar cvf ../brooklyn-AppInCatalog.jar.new .
    cd ..
    mv brooklyn-AppInCatalog.jar.new brooklyn-AppInCatalog.jar
    rm -rf tmp

Under Apache conventions, binary files are not part of the source
release. If you are using the source release, you may add this file
by copying it from the master repository, which is accessible on the
web at https://github.com/apache/incubator-brooklyn
