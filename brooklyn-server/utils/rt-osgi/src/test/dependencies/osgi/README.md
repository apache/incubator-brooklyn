This directory contains source code for OSGi bundle files 
used for testing.

Binaries are included under src/test/resources.  They are
copied there when these projects are built, and the binaries
are included in source control to speed up build times
(as these projects do not change much).  These projects are
NOT built as part of the normal brooklyn build.

To rebuild all:

    for x in *entities* ; do pushd $x ; mvn clean install ; popd ; done

See OsgiTestResources.java for information on the bundles.
