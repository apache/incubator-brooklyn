    <description>
        This project contains a logback.xml which sets up logging for brooklyn,
        using files supplied in the upstream brooklyn-logback-includes project.
        -
        One recommended way to configure logging on a project is to add this as an 
        *optional* *runtime* dependency in a project's pom.xml file, so that logback.xml
        is on the classpath when that project is run but it is *not* exported to 
        new/dependent projects thus allowing them to supply their own logging.
        -
        For more information see the logback.xml file in this project or the Logging
        section of the web site / user guide.
