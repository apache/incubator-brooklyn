        Including this file after all other debug configuration will move all of the jclouds
        logging messages to two files, named 'brooklyn-application.jclouds.log' and
        'brooklyn-application.jclouds-persister.log'. The latter will contain all messages
        logged by jclouds when called from Brooklyn's persistence thread, the former will
        contain all other messages logged by jclouds.

        If you have configured persistence to an object store and your server will manage more
        than ~ 10 entities then it is recommended to use this appender over
        logback-logger-debug-jcloud.xml as otherwise your log file will be swamped by
        persistence-related messages.
