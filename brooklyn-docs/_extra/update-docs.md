The Brooklyn docs live in the **docs** project in the Brooklyn codebase.
It's built using standard jekyll/markdown with a few extensions.

Instructions for building and working with docs are in a `README.md` file
in that folder; for the most recent version of instructions click
[here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-brooklyn/tree/master/docs/README.md).
