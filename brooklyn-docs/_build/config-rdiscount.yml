# add this file as a config to use "rdiscount" markdown processor
# instead of the default ruby/jekyll one.
# rdiscount is the original, and C-based, so a bit faster
# (but not much, 7s vs 8.5s on my system -alex)
# and slightly more forgiving, e.g. for <a href="chapter"> tags
# on a line directly about a section header
# (ruby markdown seems to want a blank line between the two).
# NB: this requires adding "rdiscount" to your Gemfile, then `cd ~ ; cd -`
markdown: rdiscount
