# this uses python pygments engine to render code;
# with recent jekyll (dec 2014) i can't see any difference,
# and the formatting appears to be following pygments rules
# without it, so perhaps the jekyll ruby highlighter is very
# good (identical? i see a pygments gem, even if the docs
# say it is using something called "rouge");
# included here so it is documented at least.
# NB: you may need `python easy_install pygments`
highlighter: pygments
