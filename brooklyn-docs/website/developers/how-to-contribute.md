## Contributor License Agreement

Apache Brooklyn is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). All
contributions will be under this license, so please read and understand this license before contributing.

For all but the most trivial patches, you are required to file a Contributor License Agreement with the Apache
Software Foundation. Please read the [guide to CLAs](https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas) to find out how to file a
CLA with the Foundation.


## Before You Start

### Join the Community

If it's your first contribution or it's a particularly big or complex contribution, things typically go much more
smoothly when they start off with a conversation. 
Significant changes are normally discussed on the mailing list in any case,
sometimes with a [feature proposal](https://drive.google.com/drive/#folders/0B3XurVLRa7pIUHNFV3NuVVRkRlE/0B3XurVLRa7pIblN4NGRNN2dYUGM/0B3XurVLRa7pIMlZQSUxrdTh4Wmc) document.

Visit our [Community](index.html) page to see how to contact Brooklyners via IRC or email.

### Create an Issue in Jira

The first step is usually to create or find an issue in [Brooklyn's Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BROOKLYN)
for your feature request or fix. For small changes this isn't necessary, but it's good to see if your change fixes an
existing issue anyway.


### Contributing using GitHub

This is our preferred way for contributing code. Our GitHub repository is located at
[https://github.com/apache/incubator-brooklyn](https://github.com/apache/incubator-brooklyn)

Your commit messages must properly describes the changes that have been made and their purpose
([here are some guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)). If your
contributions fix a Jira issue, then ensure that you reference the issue (like `BROOKLYN-9876`) in the commit message.

Create a pull request (PR) in GitHub for the change you're interested in making. The comment section of the PR must
contain a link to the Jira issue (if it has one).

Some good references for working with GitHub are below.  We ask that you keep your change rebased to master as much
as possible, and we will ask you to rebase again if master has moved before accepting your patch.

- [Setting Up Git with GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
- [Forking a Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
- [Submitting Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
- [Rebasing your Branch](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)

Finally, add a comment in the Jira issue with a link to the pull request so we know the code is ready to be reviewed.

### Reviews

The Apache Brooklyn community will review your pull request before it is merged. This process can take a while, so
please be patient. If we are slow to respond, please feel free to post a reminder to the PR, Jira issue, IRC channel
or mailing list - see the [Community](../community/) page to see how to contact us.

During the review process you may be asked to make some changes to your submission. While working through feedback,
it can be beneficial to create new commits so the incremental change is obvious.  This can also lead to a complex set
of commits, and having an atomic change per commit is preferred in the end.  Use your best judgement and work with
your reviewer as to when you should revise a commit or create a new one.

A pull request is considered ready to be merged once it gets at lease one +1 from a committer. Once all the changes
have been completed and the pull request is accepted, you may be asked to rebase it against the latest code. You may
also wish to squash some commits together and make other history revisions, to leave the commit history clean and
easily understood.


### Contributing without using GitHub

If you prefer to not use GitHub, then that is fine - we are also happy to accept patches attached to a Jira issue.
Our canonical repository is located at `https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-brooklyn.git`; for example:

    $ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-brooklyn.git

When producing patches, please use `git format-patch` or a similar mechanism - this will ensure that you are properly
attributed as the author of the patch when a committer merges it.
