Hello developers!
These pages are aimed at people who want to get involved with reading, changing, testing and otherwise
working with the bleeding edge Brooklyn code.

<div class="panel panel-danger">
<div class="panel-heading" markdown="1">
#### Caution
</div>
<div class="panel-body" markdown="1">
As these pages contain information about accessing the bleeding edge code and artifacts produced from it,
you should be aware that the code and binaries you will encounter may be unstable.
The Apache Software Foundation has not performed the level of validation and due diligence done 
on formally released artifacts. 
Proceed only if you understand the potential consequences of using unreleased code
and are comfortable doing so.

We heartily welome contributions and new members.
There's nothing official needed to get involved; 
simply come say hello somewhere in the [community](../community/index.html):

- [Mailing lists](../community/mailing-lists.html)
- [IRC channel](../community/irc.html)
- [JIRA for bug tracking](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BROOKLYN)

Once you have some code or a blueprint you want to share, 
there are a few instructions to note on [how to contribute](how-to-contribute.html).

If you're looking to learn more about the codebase itself, 
have a look at [Developer Guide]({{ site.path.guide }}/dev/).
There are also a number of [development bookmarks](links.html) for the tools we use
(git, jenkins, jira).
