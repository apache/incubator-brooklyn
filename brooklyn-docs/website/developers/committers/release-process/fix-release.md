Make whatever changes are necessary on the release branch, supported by discussions on the mailing list.

Repeat the instructions to [make release artifacts](make-release-artifacts.html).

Remember that after the release is done, you should cherry-pick the changes to a new feature branch based on `master`
and open a pull request, so that the next version will incorporate the bug fixes.
