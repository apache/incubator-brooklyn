After svnpubsub has updated, the artifacts will be visible at https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/brooklyn/, and distributed to Apache mirrors around the world shortly after.

An announcement email can then be made:

### Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Apache Brooklyn 0.7.0-incubating released
{% highlight text %}
The Apache Brooklyn team is proud to announce the latest release of Apache
Brooklyn 0.7.0-incubating.

Apache Brooklyn is a framework for modelling, monitoring, and managing
applications through autonomic blueprints. More details on Apache Brooklyn
can be found at https://brooklyn.apache.org/

Version 0.7.0 is a major step for Apache Brooklyn. It is the first full
release of the project as part of the Apache incubator.

Thanks go to our community for their improvements, feedback and guidance, and
to Brooklynâ€™s commercial users for funding much of this development.

As well as a source code release, we offer a full binary distribution
download, and a full set of Maven artifacts for developers.

Maven artifacts have also been made available on repository.apache.org and
Maven Central.

Disclaimer:
Apache Brooklyn is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by Incubator. Incubation is required of
all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Thanks
Richard Downer
release manager for 0.7.0-incubating
on behalf of the Brooklyn PPMC
