This will allow development to continue on master without affecting the release; it also allows quick-fixes to the
release branch to address last-minute problems (which must of course be merged/cherry-picked back into master later).

Determine the correct name for the version. Note that while in incubation, we must include “incubating” in our release
name - common practice for this is to append “-incubating” to the release version.

Do not use -rc1, -rc2 etc. in version strings. Use the version that will be the actual published version. (The artifacts
that get uploaded to the dist.apache.org/dev will include “-rc1” etc. in the folder name, but the contents will be *as
final*. Therefore, turning the rc into the final is simply a case of taking the rc file and publishing it to the release
folder with the correct name.)

Create the release branch and set the release version number
------------------------------------------------------------

Create a branch with the same name as the version, based off master:

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout master
git pull --rebase # assumes that the Apache canonical repository is the default upstream for your master - amend if necessary
git checkout -b $VERSION_NAME
git push -u apache $VERSION_NAME
{% endhighlight %}

Now change the version numbers in this branch throughout the project using the script `release/change-version.sh` and commit it:

{% highlight bash %}
./release/change-version.sh BROOKLYN $OLD_MASTER_VERSION $VERSION_NAME
git add .
# Now inspect the staged changes and ensure there are no surprises
git commit -m "Change version to $VERSION_NAME"
git push
{% endhighlight %}



Update the version on master
----------------------------

The `master` branch will now need updating to refer to the next planned version. (This step is not required if making
a "milestone" release or similar.)

The release notes should be cleared out and the version history augmented with the new version.

Example:

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout master
./release/change-version.sh BROOKLYN $OLD_MASTER_VERSION $NEW_MASTER_VERSION
git add .
# Now inspect the staged changes and ensure there are no surprises
{% endhighlight %}

Open `docs/guide/misc/release-notes.md` and `docs/website/meta/versions.md` in your favourite editor and amend.
For release notes this means bumping the reference to the previous version in the "Backwards Compatibility" section
and putting some placeholder text elsewhere.

Then:

{% highlight bash %}
git commit -m "Change version to $NEW_MASTER_VERSION"
git push
{% endhighlight %}


Switch back to the release branch
---------------------------------

Move back to the release branch:

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout $VERSION_NAME
{% endhighlight %}
