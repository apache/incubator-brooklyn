A script to generate the voting email can be found in `release/print-vote-email.sh`,
taking a single argument being the staging repo link. For example:

    release/print-vote-email.sh orgapachebrooklyn-1234 | pbcopy 

You should move the subject and put your name at the end, and simply eyeball the rest. This should be sent to **dev@brooklyn.incubator.apache.org**.

Alternatively, copy-paste the e-mail template below, being sure to substitute:

- VERSION_NAME
- RC_NUMBER
- URLs containing version numbers
- URL for your own PGP key
- Checksums
- URL for the Maven staging repository

Count the vote results
----------------------

If the release email stated a deadline (normally 72 hours), then you should wait at least that long. If there are
insufficient votes you may need to extend the deadline - as an informal aim, we should look to get 2/3rds of the PPMC
and some mentors voting +1. If a release-critical issue is raised and confirmed, then you may end the vote early with a
negative result.

Votes from PPMC members are binding; votes from others are non-binding. In the case of non-binding negative votes,
please consider these carefully even if you are not bound by them.

If there are any negative or zero votes, consider these carefully. Aim to “convert” negative or zero votes into positive
by addressing any concerns. A negative vote is not necessarily a veto[citation required], but it should be a clear
warning sign to not proceed if somebody strongly believes that the release should not proceed as is.

Finally, count up the +1s and separate into binding (PPMC) and non-binding.

Email the vote result

This is a new email thread with a different subject
(the same as before with `[RESULT]` prepended).
