This guide describes how Brooklyn entities can be easily created from Chef cookbooks.
As of this writing (May 2014) some of the integration points are under active development,
and comments are welcome.
A plan for the full integration is online [here](https://docs.google.com/a/cloudsoftcorp.com/document/d/18ZwzmncbJgJeQjnSvMapTWg6N526cvGMz5jaqdkxMf8).  

This guide assumes you are familiar with the basics of [creating YAML blueprints](../).
