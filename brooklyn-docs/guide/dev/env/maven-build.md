## The Basics

To build the code, you need Maven (v3) installed and Java (v1.7+).
With that in place, you should be able to build everything with a:

{% highlight bash %}
% mvn clean install
{% endhighlight %}

Key things to note if you're new to Maven:

* You may need more JVM memory, e.g. at the command-line (or in `.profile`):

  ``export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -Xms512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"``

* You can do this in specific projects as well.

* Add ``-DskipTests`` to skip tests. 

* Run ``-PIntegration`` to run integration tests, or ``-PLive`` to run live tests
  ([tests described here](../code/tests.html))

* Nearly all the gory details are in the root ``pom.xml``, which is referenced by child project poms.

* You can also open and use the code in your favourite IDE,
  although you may hit a few **[snags](ide/)**
  (that link has some tips for resolving them too)


## When the RAT Bites

We use RAT to ensure that all files are compliant to Apache standards.  Most of the time you shouldn't see it or need to know about it, but if it detects a violation, you'll get a message such as:

    [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.rat:apache-rat-plugin:0.10:check (default) on project brooklyn-parent: Too many files with unapproved license: 1 See RAT report in: /Users/alex/Data/cloudsoft/dev/gits/brooklyn/target/rat.txt -> [Help 1]

If there's a problem, see the file `rat.txt` in the `target` directory of the failed project.  (Maven will show you this link in its output.)

Often the problem is one of the following:

* You've added a file which requires the license header but doesn't have it

  **Resolution:**  Simply copy the header from another file

* You've got some temporary files which RAT things should have headers

  **Resolution:**  Move the files away, add headers, or turn off RAT (see below)

* The project structure has changed and you have stale files (e.g. in a `target` directory)

  **Resolution:**  Remove the stale files, e.g. with `git clean -df` (and if needed a `find . -name target -prune -exec rm -rf {} \;` to delete folders named `target`)

To disable RAT checking on a build, set `rat.ignoreErrors`, e.g. `mvn -Drat.ignoreErrors=true clean install`.  (But note you will need RAT to pass in order for a PR to be accepted!)

If there is a good reason that a file, pattern, or directory should be permanently ignored, that is easy to add inside the root `pom.xml`.


## Other Handy Hints

* On some **Ubuntu** (e.g. 10.4 LTS) maven v3 is not currently available from the repositories.
  Some instructions for installing at are [at superuser.com](http://superuser.com/questions/298062/how-do-i-install-maven-3).

* The **mvnf** script 
  ([get the gist here](https://gist.github.com/2241800)) 
  simplifies building selected projects, so if you just change something in ``software-webapp`` 
  and then want to re-run the examples you can do:
  
  ``examples/simple-web-cluster% mvnf ../../{software/webapp,usage/all}`` 

## Appendix: Sample Output

A healthy build will look something like the following,
including a few warnings (which we have looked into and
understand to be benign and hard to get rid of them,
although we'd love to if anyone can help!):
