## Scopes
Many commands require a "scope" expression to indicate the target on which they operate.
Where this
is required the usage statements below will use the shorthand nomenclature of `<X-scope>`.  
The various scopes should be replaced on the command line as:

- `<app-scope>`  
  `application <Name|AppID>`

- `<entity-scope>`  
  `application <Name|AppID> entity <Name|EntityID>`

- `<effector-scope>`  
  `application <Name|AppID> effector <Name>`  
  `application <Name|AppID> entity <Name|EntityID> effector <Name>`

- `<config-scope>`  
  `application <Name|AppID> entity <Name|EntityID> config <ConfigID>`

- `<activity-scope>`  
  `activity <ActivityID>`  
  `application <Name|AppID> entity <Name|EntityID> activity <ActivityID>`

## Abbreviations
Many of the commands and scopes have shortened aliases:

{% highlight text %}
activity     act
application  app
entity       ent
policy       pol
{% endhighlight %}
