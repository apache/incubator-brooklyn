### Introduction

Version 0.8.0 is [TODO add description] 

Thanks go to our community for their improvements, feedback and guidance, and
to Brooklyn's commercial users for funding much of this development.


### New Features

[TODO]
 

### Backwards Compatibility

Changes since 0.8.0-incubating:

1. **Major:** The classes HttpTool and HttpToolResponse in brooklyn-core (package org.apache.brooklyn.util.core.http)
have been moved to brooklyn-utils-common, in package org.apache.brooklyn.util.
Classes such as HttpFeed that previously returned org.apache.brooklyn.util.core.http.HttpToolResponse in some methods now 
return org.apache.brooklyn.util.HttpToolResponse.

2. **Major:** Locations set in YAML or on a spec are no longer passed to `child.start(...)` by `AbstractApplication`;
this has no effect in most cases as `SoftwareProcess.start` looks at local and inherited locations, but in ambiguous cases
it means that locally defined locations are now preferred. Other classes of entities may need to do similar behaviour,
and it means that calls to `Entity.getLocations()` in some cases will not show parent locations,
unless discovered and set locally e.g. `start()`. The new method `Entities.getAllInheritedLocations(Entity)`
can be used to traverse the hierarchy.  It also means that when a type in the registry (catalog) includes a location,
and a caller references it, that location will now take priority over a location defined in a parent.
Additionally, any locations specified in YAML extending the registered type will now *replace* locations on the referenced type;
this means in many cases an explicit `locations: []` when extending a type will cause locations to be taken from the
parent or application root in YAML.      

For changes in prior versions, please refer to the release notes for 
[0.8.0](/v/0.8.0-incubating/misc/release-notes.html).
