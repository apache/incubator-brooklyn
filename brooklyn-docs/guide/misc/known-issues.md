## Unable to Provision certain types of Debian VMs

*Symptom*: Brooklyn fails to provision Debian VMs (e.g. in aws-ec2).

*Cause*: `sudo` is not available on path, causing Brooklyn to fail to confirm that the VM is ssh'able.

*Workaround*: Choose an image that does have sudo (see [wiki.debian.org/Cloud/AmazonEC2Image](http://wiki.debian.org/Cloud/AmazonEC2Image)).

*Fix*: is [Pull #600](https://github.com/brooklyncentral/brooklyn/pull/600); you may also want to run with `brooklyn.location.jclouds.aws-ec2.user=root` if subsequent commands give permission errors.

*Versions Affected*: 0.5.0-M2


### Unable to Provision Ubuntu 8 VMs

*Symptom: Brooklyn fails to provision Ubuntu 8 VMs (e.g. in aws-ec2) with the following error 'Cannot insert the iptables rule for port 22. Error: sudo: illegal option `-n''.

*Cause: Ubuntu 8 is too old; the sudo command doesn't support the -n setting.

*Workaround: Choose Ubuntu 10 or higher.

*Versions Affected*: 0.5.0-M2
