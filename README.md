### Apache Brooklyn **Incubator** Historic Repo

This is the historical **incubator** repo for Apache Brooklyn.

## Brooklyn has graduated. Visit us [here](http://github.com/apache/brooklyn/).

The sub-directories in this project correspond to multiple separate repositories in apache.
(The link above to `brooklyn/` started life exactly as a copy of [`brooklyn/`](brooklyn/)
in this folder, as an uber-project for the others, including the `server` and the `ui`.)


### To Build

The code can be built with a:

    mvn clean install

This creates a build in `usage/dist/target/brooklyn-dist`.  Run with `bin/brooklyn launch`.
