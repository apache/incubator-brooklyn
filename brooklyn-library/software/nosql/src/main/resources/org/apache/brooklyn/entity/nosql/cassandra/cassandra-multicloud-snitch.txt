The file cassandra-multicloud-snitch.jar is a snitch implementation
that handles Cassandra datacenters in different cloud providers.

The source code for cassandra-multicloud-snitch.jar is in sandbox/cassandra-multicloud-snitch.

The source will be contributed to the Cassandra project; when it is available in the 
Cassandra distro (and when we don't want to give backwards compatibility support for
older Cassandra versions), then we can delete it from Brooklyn.

The jar can be uploaded to a Cassandra Node as part of deployment, for if
this multi-cloud snitch is desired.

Under Apache conventions, binary files are not part of the source
release. If you are using the source release, you may add this file
by copying it from the master repository, which is accessible on the
web at https://github.com/apache/incubator-brooklyn
