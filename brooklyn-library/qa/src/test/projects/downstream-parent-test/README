A successful build of this project (`mvn clean verify`) means that projects that
use brooklyn-downstream-parent can be loaded into Brooklyn's catalogue by default.

If the build fails there is almost certainly something wrong with the parent and
the wider consumers of Brooklyn will probably face similar problems.
